This repository contains my code for an assignment from Dr Danilo Mandic's
course 'Advanced Signal Processing' at Imperial College London (2016).

The coursework is divided in 5 sections. The code follows the labelling
requested by the questions (see ASP_Coursework_2016.pdf) and is further
commented in my answer sheet (see nm2213_report.pdf)

2.4 Auto regressiv emodelling
2.5 Real world signals: ECG from iAmp experiment

3 Spectral estimation and modelling
3.1 Averaged periodogram estimates
3.2 Spectrum of autoregressive processes
3.3 Spectrogram for time-frequency analysis: dial tone pad
