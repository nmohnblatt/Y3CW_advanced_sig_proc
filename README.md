This repository contains my code for an assignment from Dr Danilo Mandic's
course 'Advanced Signal Processing' at Imperial College London (2016).

The coursework is divided in 5 sections. The code follows the labelling
requested by the questions (see ASP_Coursework_2016.pdf) and is further
commented in my answer sheet (see nm2213_report.pdf)
